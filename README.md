## Business Understanding
ChurnBusters Inc. is a pioneering telecommunications analytics firm dedicated to assisting phone service providers in reducing customer churn rates. In the telecom industry, churn refers to customers switching between service providers or canceling subscriptions. Typically, a customer is considered churned when a certain period has elapsed since their last interaction with the service. 

*Objective*: Develop an effective classification model for predicting customer churn in a telecommunications firm.

## Data Understanding
The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/becksddf/churn-in-telecoms-dataset) offers a comprehensive view of customer information in a telecommunication firm, encompassing attributes such as customer location (state), account length, area code, international plan status, voicemail plan status, call details (daytime, evening, nighttime, and international), customer service calls, and most notably, the churn indicator. It provides a rich source of information for understanding customer behavior and factors influencing churn.

## EDA 
This sections seeks to understand the characteristics of the data variables as single units and its relation with other variables.
These figures are a representation of some univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis on the data set.
